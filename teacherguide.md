# Hello teachers and educators!

If you plan on using the parachute decoding materials in your classroom, here are a few notes on each slide, followed by other resources you might want to use with your young'uns.

## 1. The Parachute Message
The parachute is the main feature of this resource, but you could look at Morse code as a background to this, or as a warm-up activity. 
[The Morse code on Perseverance can be seen in NASA's picture here.](https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/24877/send-your-name-placard-attached-to-perseverance/)

#### Questions to ask:
Why do you think they only put three letters (JPL) on the tracks?
How old is Morse code?
What industries still use Morse code now?
How many ways can you think of sending a Morse code message?
Who was Morse?
Why do you think the engineers like to hide messages?

## 2. What Does Orange And White Mean?
Binary has the same word origin as words like bicycle, biped (two legs), bisect (cut in two). It means that there are two possible choices for each digit.
Binary counting is explained much better by people who are not me, but counting systems are fascinating!
You can go off down a rabbit hole of ideas for counting systems in different cultures.
8-bit binary is used in computing, but hexadecimal is also used.

#### Questions to ask:
Look at your hands - why do you think people count in decimal (tens)?
If you know decimal is counting in tens, what do you think hexadecimal is? (Hint: hexagon)
Why do you think we count time in 60's and 12's? (This may need more explanation and is a bit of a hazy question.)

## 3. How Do You Know When To Start and Stop?
The parachute's 10-bit binary was forced because of the size of the parachute segments. In computing, a stop code can be generated.
8-bit binary is used, so you know the segments are always 8 characters wide. 0000 0010 means the start of text.
The parachute code simplified this, as in "real" binary there are codes for uppercase (capital) letters, and for lowercase (little) letters.
For instance, a capital A is 0100 0001. Capital B is 0100 0010, and so on. You can even do punctuation, which means they could have put a little smiley face on the parachute if they wanted.

#### Questions to ask:
Why do you think they simplified the code?
Can you find a chart with all the codes in?
Can you find their equivalents in hexadecimal?
Why do people use a short code rather than writing out a whole message?

## 4. Can You Fill In The Codes?
It might help to print this off, and if you have access to a large format printer, or can photocopy, you could enlarge it, because those centre portions are super tiny.
You could talk about the work done at [Bletchley Park](https://bletchleypark.org.uk/) to crack codes during wartime.

#### Questions to ask:
Before we had printers and graphics packages, how do you think people solved things like this?
Did we have codes before computers?
What would you do if you didn't have a printout?
How could you work quicker as a team to solve this?

## 5. A Tiny Bit of Background
Again, I feel that there are resources out there that cover this a lot better than my hand-wavy way. Beware that they used 3 spacers and 7 bits in the parachute code which is NOT NORMAL.

#### Questions to ask:
Do you know the name of the type of code that makes A=1, B=2, and so on? (substitution cipher)
Did you know that Mary Queen of Scots used a similar cipher when she was locked up by Queen Elizabeth the First? (totally search for this on the internet, it's fascinating)
Can you make up a symbol for each letter of the alphabet and write your own code?

## 6. What Do The Codes Mean?
A bit more of a continuation of the previous slide. Make sure that you emphasise that in this case, the binary can point us at a number *or* a letter.

#### Questions to ask:
Why are the numbers that we collect doubling?
Why aren't there other numbers to collect?
Do you know what a doubling sequence is called?
How far can you get with doubling?
Look at the size of memory cards for your camera or phone. What do you notice about the numbers?

## 7. Decode Your Parachute!
The kiddos might be getting a bit tired but you can break the task into pieces - even cut up the parachute and give each one a section to jigsaw back together at the end. Have spares because they *will* make mistakes! (I did when I first published this resource!)
They might find that the outer ring makes no sense if they have converted it all into numbers - give them a hint by looking up your school, or community centre, or somewhere like Disneyland on an internet map. [Here's how to see the coordinates or put in your own.](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/18539?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en)

#### Questions to ask:
Which way is the message going? What do you think the outside could mean?

## 8. The Solution!
I think this slide is self explanatory. 

The quote that the phrase comes from is:

*"Far better is it to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs, even though checkered by failure ... than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy nor suffer much, because they live in a gray twilight that knows not victory nor defeat." - Teddy Roosevelt*

#### Questions to ask:
How do you feel that the engineers sent you this message?
Do you think that you would like to leave messages?
What would your message say?

## Extensions or further stuff to play with:

#### Bletchley Park Codebreaking
There's some great resources [here](https://bletchleypark.org.uk/learn/resources/codes-and-ciphers) from the education team at Bletchley Park - if you're in the UK I highly recommend a visit, you can see the National Museum of Computing at the same time!

#### Create more codes

If you want to generate more codes for them to decode then you're in luck!

Sam Warner - [@sjwarner_ on twitter](https://twitter.com/sjwarner_) - has created [this interactive code generator](https://sjwarner.github.io/perseverance-parachute-generator/).
You could use it to make messages to be decoded, or get the young uns to make their own as a challenge for you.

You could also look at other patterns that could be used to encode a message in a similar way - such as necklaces with two bead colours, or a tiled floor, or a barcode style system of stripes.
