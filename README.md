# The Parachute Message

During the press conference with the release of the first Perseverance rover video and audio, Allen Chen revealed that there was a code hidden in the parachute, as well as the markings being useful for camera alignment.

This is a breakdown of how to solve that code in simple English. You can download the [whole thing as a printable PDF](https://github.com/tanyafish/parachute/blob/main/The%20Parachute%20Message.pdf), optimised for A4 paper.

Happy parachuting!
